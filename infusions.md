# Infusions

## Infusions

Infusions were introduced in firmware 1.1.0 for the Mark IV Pineapple, which allow the community to make extensions for the Systems WebUI. Infusions range from front-ends for commands to full back-ends and front-ends for added purposes, Such as text messaging your pineapple, Changing its wireless properties or making it confuse unsuspecting internet browsers. Infusions can be programmed from a mixture of PHP, JavaScript/AJAX, Python, Perl, and BASH.

## Command Line Infusions

Command line infusions were introduced in firmware 1.1.0 for Mark V Pineapple. Command line infusions are just like regular infusions except they don't have a front-end. Command line infusions can be programmed from a mixture of PHP, Python, Perl, and BASH.

## Creating Infusions

[Creating Infusions](creating_infusions.md) on the Mark V firmware is very simple. Go to the "Pineapple Bar" on you Pineapple's WebUI. This allows you to create a new infusion, or manage your existing infusions. The new Pineapple Bar also has a built-in basic text editor for quickly whipping up an Infusion.

## Supporting your Infusion

It is recommended that if you decide to submit your infusion for approval, you make a thread in the correct WiFi Pineapple subforum at the [Hak5 Forums](https://forums.hak5.org/index.php?/forum/64-wifi-pineapple-jasager/). Your thread should include information about the infusion, its features and a changelog.
