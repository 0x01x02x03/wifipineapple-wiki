## Web User Interface

The WiFi Pineapples Web UI is in its 3rd major revision. It works in a tile interface, with small tiles for both System Tiles and Infusion Tiles, which can indicate status or information about the tiles purpose, and large tiles which are used to control the System/Infusion. The WebUIs files are located in `/pineapple/`.
