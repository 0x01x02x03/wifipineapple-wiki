## Web User Interface

The WiFi Pineapples Web UI is currently in its 3rd major revision. It presents a tiled interface, with smaller tiles for things like System and Configuration as well as for installed Infusions. These smaller tiles are what user is first presented with upon logging in to the WebUI. They can display various pieces of information relating to that tab, such as status updates or details of the tile's purpose.
If the heading of a smaller tile is clicked, then a larger tile is opened in the forefront of the interface. These larger tiles will contain more indepth settings and information. Many of these expanded tiles will also have tabs along the top in order to further categorise the wealth of options and features available.

The WebUI's files are located in `/pineapple/`
